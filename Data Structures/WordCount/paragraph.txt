	Greetings. This is the paragraph that the Word Count program will read. The definition of a paragraph is "a 
distinct section of a piece of writing, usually dealing with a single theme and indicated by a new line, 
indentation, or numbering" according to a Google search. Many English teachers teach that a paragraph is five to 
seven sentences long. This program can handle indentations and new lines. The scanner properly splits any white 
space, so the original text file that the program is reading is formatted like a paragraph that fits my default 
window size. I am very aware that this program is being turned in very late: I really struggled with this one.
