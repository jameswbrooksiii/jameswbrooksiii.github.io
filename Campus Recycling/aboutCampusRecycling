The goal of this program was too demonstrate the use of a depth-first-search in a node and edge based tree system, but under a unique premise: a recycling crew wanting to determine the fastest route through Louisiana Tech's campus streets to empty the recycling bins of each facility.

The node and edge system was set up, as well as the depth-first-search algorithm. Then, each major building to neighboring buildings was given an edge with an appropriate numerical weight given to it based on real-world distance. To reflect one-way streets, some nodes have neighbors that they do not point to. The depth-first-search algorithm was then performed on the established tree to find the least cost route.
