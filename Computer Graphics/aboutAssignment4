Assignment 4 was a culmination of a simple graphics rendering engine that we had been working on adding new features throughout the entire quarter.

Assignment 4 renders a octagonal cylinder, by default in wireframe. The cylinder can be scaled, rotated, and moved.

Pressing the 1-6 keys will change the rendering mode.

1. Wireframe
2. Color Fill and Wireframe
3. Color Fill
4. Flat Shading
5. Gouraud Shading
6. Phong Shading

The program also supports rendering multiple objects and selecting them individually, as well as a Z-Buffer to handle the multiple objects clipping, but that was mainly in Assignment 3, which I believe I lost.
