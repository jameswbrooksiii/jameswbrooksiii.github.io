Assignment 5 was focused on creating a more advanced graphics rendering engine with ray-tracing capabilities.

A scene is defined with three spheres of different sizes and color, as well as a checkerboard floor and a skybox with a default color.

For each pixel, a ray is cast from the "camera's" perspective. If it collides with an object, another ray is cast reflecting off of that object up to a certain depth (to prevent endlessly reflecting). The color of that pixel is determined by the last object it hits, and the depth of the number of reflections the ray made.

The spheres can also cast shadows on one another.
