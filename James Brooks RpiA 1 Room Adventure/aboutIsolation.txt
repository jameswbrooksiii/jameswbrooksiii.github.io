RpiA 1 Room Adventure Assignment: Isolation

About: 
This was a school assignment to create a text-based adventure game, where the user controls a character navigating multiple "rooms" by using a text-box input. This was one of the first
projects I was entirely thrilled to work on, as I have always loved text-based adventure games and wanted to make my own. 

I put a lot of work in making the (albeit, crude, paint, stick-figure) graphics update when a player took or used an item, and adding additional interactivity with items and a diverse 
selection of rooms.
