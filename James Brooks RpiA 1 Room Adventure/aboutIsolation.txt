RpiA 1 Room Adventure Assignment: Isolation

About: 
This was a school assignment from my first year in Computer Science to create a text-based adventure game, where the user controls a character navigating multiple "rooms" by using a text-box input. This was one of the first projects I was really excited to work on, as I have always loved text-based adventure games and wanted to make my own. 

I put a lot of work in making the (albeit crude, paint, stick-figure) graphics update when a player took or used an item, and adding additional interactivity with items and a diverse selection of rooms.

Unfortunately I believe this was created on an older version of Python so it no longer works, but the work is still here to see.
